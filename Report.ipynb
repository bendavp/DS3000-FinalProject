We attempted to solve this knowledge gap by constructing a model to help predict whether a shorebird was impacted by an oil spill. To do this, we took data from a Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill study that measured various physiological markers in captured shorebirds that were marked as either \"Reference\" birds (not affected by an oil spill), or \"Impacted\". We fed this data to a supervised machine learning classification algorithm and tuned the algorithm to be able to predict with a reasonable amount of accuracy whether a given shorebird was affected by an oil spill. We cleaned up and explored our data, which we then used to construct our model and evaluate its performance with some of our data, and tested the model with the rest of the data (i.e. any data we didn't use to train the model). Our hypotheses turned out to be somewhat supported by the data, but we discovered that this varies depending on which species is the focus. The most accurate ML classification algorithm turned out to be a Decision Tree algorithm, which is able to predict with roughly `92%` accuracy whether a given shore bird was affected by an oil spill."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YtFDHsRl9pM3","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<hr style=\"height:2px; border:none; color:black; background-color:black;\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gkzdjZ_r9pM4","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Outline\n","1. <a href='#1'>INTRODUCTION</a>\n","2. <a href='#2'>METHOD</a>\n","3. <a href='#3'>RESULTS</a>\n","4. <a href='#4'>DISCUSSION</a>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cGuglXY-9pM6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<a id=\"1\"></a>\n","<hr style=\"height:2px; border:none; color:black; background-color:black;\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Byjz1ZtH9pM7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.

We are seeing if from these markers we can predict if a shore bird were exposed to oil. We want to see which markers are the best to predict whether a bird has been exposed to oil. \n","\n","\n","###Significance of the Problem:\n","\n","The DeepWater Horizon spill was not the first major oil spill, nor will it be the last. Oil spills can have far reaching effects on ecosystems. This project is important because it can provide insights into how shore birds are affected by oil spills and the physiological markers. Dramatic changes in physiology can have long term effects, such as affecting fecundity, so the results of this model can help predict how shore birds are impacted by an oil spill. It can also be used to see how far the impacts of an oil spill can be seen. Since many birds migrate to or through the Gulf of Mexico, many more birds may have been impacted by the spill than initially thought. Therefore, finding a simple way to test a bird for oil exposure is imperative to discovering how far the effects of the oil spill traveled. \n","\n","The external effects of oil have been vastly researched, showing how oil \n","removes the water repellent properties of feathers (Morandin and O’Hara 2016). This has an effect on buoyancy, can lead to behavioral changes, and can cause impaired flight. Exposure and ingestion of oil have been shown to have metabolic effects on marine birds, when not in lethal doses (Morandin and O’Hara 2016). Birds exposed to oil have been shown to be less able to cope with other stressors than birds not exposed to oil (Lattin et al. 2014). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a chemical compound that are derived from fossil fuels. These PAHs are toxic at low concentrations and can be transferred up the food chain. Even when this compound is not consumed in lethal doses, it can have serious physiological effects like liver damage, anemia, immune suppression, gastrointestinal damage etc. (Paruk et al. 2016). Seabirds may be more at risk of the harmful effects than terrestrial birds of oil due to their longer time spent maturing and the fact that many species only lay one egg per mating season (Morandin and O’hara 2016). This means the species would be less able to adapt and evolve to these harmful conditions. The effects of oil pollution may also cause lasting effects in the reproductive ability of birds exposed to oil, so the population of shorebirds may be impacted for more than one generation.\n","\n","  In our project we are looking at physiological markers in different species of shore birds to identify the markers most impacted by oil spills. We are seeing if we can accurately predict if a bird was exposed to oil pollution. A better understanding of physiological markers in shore birds helps researchers to target certain markers to classify whether a bird has been involved in an oil spill; this can help identify unknown oil spills.  \n","\n","```\n","Citations:\n","\n","Lattin, C.

We accomplished this after a great deal of data wrangling and feature engineering performed on our dataset to ensure that the data was clean enough for our model to use it. For future work concerning this topic, we would like to look towards working with a larger, more complete set of data. Although the original dataset contained over 1200 rows, we ended up removing more than half of them due to the pervasiveness of ‘NaN’ and ‘None’ values in the dataset, with certain species of birds having particularly sparse data. Additionally, some feature variables that were potentially useful for training the model—such as Bird Weight (g)—had a significant number of values that were seemingly nonsensical/inaccurate and ultimately made it impossible to use those variables as features for the model. Having complete and correct values for these columns in the original dataset would be another improvement that could allow future work on the same dataset to see if the model could be improved upon.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"om8wrDQH9pNW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["<a id=\"5\"></a>\n","<hr style=\"height:2px; border:none; color:black; background-color:black;\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6gDVm1Zg9pNX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### CONTRIBUTIONS\n","The introduction (Section 1) was written by Tom Cairns.
